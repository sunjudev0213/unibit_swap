What to do now
- Staking contract - Arbitrum
- Swapping contract - Arbitrum and more
- Pool contract - Arbitrum and more
- Mint BRC20 support(for xverse and unisat, okx wallets, and creating okx wallet for metamask users)


Issues
- How to avoid arithmatic underflow/overflow~~~
  As the toalSupply will not be sufficient after user claimed rewards and wants to unstake...........
- Xverse Wallet connect using sats-connect not working now....... Why?
