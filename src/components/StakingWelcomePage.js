      <h2>What is Staking?</h2>
      <p>
        Staking is a fundamental concept in decentralized networks that allows participants to lock up their tokens as collateral to support the network's operations. By staking, you actively contribute to the network's security and consensus mechanism, helping to validate transactions and maintain the integrity of the blockchain.
